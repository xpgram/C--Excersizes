# C# Exercises

This is where most of my drills for the C# portion of my time at The Tech Academy are kept. They're all in one project, so loading the '.sln' in Visual Studio "opens" all of them.

There are, I believe, instructions on how to do this inside the project, but just in case:
Each drill is its own namespace, so from runner.cs, just change 'Drill24' to the digit number of any folder name. Like, '01', '02', etc. You'll get it.

Below is a list of what lesson each drill was meant to demonstrate.
