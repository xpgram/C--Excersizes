# C# Exercises

This is where the drills for the C# portion of my time at The Tech Academy are kept.
Originally, I was keeping my work in one Visual Studio project, so things are broken up a bit.

The drills listed here are each their own project with their own '.sln'. Easily loadable, easily runnable, all self-contained in their own folder. Below is a list of what lesson each one is meant to demonstrate.

The other 18 drills are in the 'ConsoleApp1' folder, and there is a separate readme inside providing further details.

Drill 19: Interfaces and Polymorphism  
Drill 20: Operator Overloading  
Drill 21: Generic Types  
Drill 22: Enums  
Drill 23: Structs  
Drill 24: Lambda Functions  
Drill 25: File IO  
Drill 26: Datetime Objects  
Drill 27: Constants, Var, and Constructor Chaining  
Drill 28: Exception Handling
